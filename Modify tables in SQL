#let's look at how we can answer for each of the questions below:
#####Question 1.) Modify column salary in table employee to have null values##########
#Step 1: As usual create the tables. But if you already created the table, move to questions

#creating Dept table
create table Dept (id int, name varchar(18));
insert into Dept values (1,"HR"),(2,"IT"),(3,"Admin"),(4,"Finance");
select * from Dept;

#creating Employee table
create table Employee (id int, name varchar(18), age int, salary int, Deptid int);
insert into Employee values (1,"Ann",21,1000,1),(2,"Muhamad",22,1000,2),(3,"Lavanya",23,2000,1),(4,"Basith",21,2000,3),(5,"Sruthi",22,3000,4);
select * from Employee;

#Question 1 (add primary key to ID)
alter table Employee add primary key (id);

#Question 2 (Add foreign key in Dept table)
#Before that need to create an index on the refrenced column
create index idx_dept_id on Dept(id);
#now adding foreign key
alter table Employee
add foreign key (Deptid) references Dept(id);

#Question 3
alter table Employee
add constraint salary_max_limit
check (salary <=10000);

#### OR for Q3 can add salary limit while creating table ###
create table Employee (
id int not null,
name varchar(18), 
age int, 
salary int check (salary <10000), 
Deptid int);

#i will drop Employee table here as I altered it. but need to use the same employee table for assignment 3
drop table Employee;
drop table Dept;
